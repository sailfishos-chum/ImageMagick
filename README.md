# ImageMagick
Packaging repo of ImageMagick for SailfishOS

Older releases from openrepos and chum were done in the following repos:
 
 - https://gitlab.com/nephros/harbour-imagemagick
 - https://github.com/nephros/harbour-imagemagick/

However, due to some stupid repo management, these repos are quite large, and partially broken/unclean (some refs lead to LFS errors on checkout), so this repo was revcreated from an orphan branch of the latest tag.
